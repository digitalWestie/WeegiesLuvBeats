Aright Jimmy?

So this was an application made for Culture Hack Scotland 2012: link:http://www.welcometosync.com/hack/

In short the application can import a mass of artists & tracks from csv and suggest which ones you'd like from Last.fm. 

I used a dataset of Glasgow based artists from Inner Ear. Hence the name Weegies Luv Beats.
